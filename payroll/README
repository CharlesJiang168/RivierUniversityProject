My Payroll system provides 9 options (refer to the following output section).

- Person is the abtract base class (fname, lname, sex, age)
- Employee is derived from Person (more info: employee id, dependents, weeklyRate, hourlyRate, lastPayAmount, lastPayDate)
- Dependent is derived from Person (more info: dependent id, employee id which it belongs to)
- EmployeeList is the top class to hold all the employee and dependent information, as well as provides functions to display, modify, output and calculate payroll.

- Deal duplicate cases, e.g. both wife and husband are employees. Therefore we only save employee records;
- EmployeeList has three vectors, salary employees with dependents, hourly employees with dependents, and dependents;
Notice: Need user to specify the input and output file path.

The following is the standard output:
